## How It Works

### Managing Photos

Access the admin panel by navigating to `http://your-server-ip:3000/admin` and logging in with your password.

From there, you can:
- **Upload Media**: Drag and drop images or videos directly into the current folder or use the upload button.
- **Organize**: Create and delete nested folders to organize your library.
- **Supported formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, MPEG.
- **Advertisement Widget**: Set `AD_WIDGET_ENABLED=true` and configure the `AD_WIDGET_*` environment variables to show a custom ad on the slideshow.

### Viewing the Slideshow

On the slideshow screen, you can:
- **Filter by Folder**: Click the folder icon to open the folder selector. You can view all photos or select a specific folder, including nested ones. The slideshow updates instantly.
- **Control Playback**: Use keyboard shortcuts to play/pause, advance to the next image, and more.

#### Slideshow Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space` or `K`: Play/pause slideshow
- `Right Arrow` or `N`: Next image
- `F`: Toggle fullscreen mode
- `I`: Show/hide image information
